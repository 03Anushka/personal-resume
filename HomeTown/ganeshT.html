   <h2><em><p>Tekdi Ganapati Temple, Nagpur is so called because it has been constructed on a hill, and in Marathi, `tekdi` means hill. The Tekdi Ganapati Temple, Nagpur is believed to be 250 years old. During its early years Tekdi Ganapati Temple used to be all of an ordinary tin shade and a small platform, but after the Military Defense wing took over its possession, improvements began in the 1970s. And in 1965 Late Honourable Defense Minister Shri Yashwantrao Chavan arranged the possession of the temple and its adjoining areas to the temple trust. The construction of the Ganapati Temple started in 1978, completing it in the year of 1984, by the grace of the pious devotees contributing in heavy amounts.</p>
